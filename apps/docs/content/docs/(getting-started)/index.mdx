## Introduction

RebaTS is a relationship-based authorization
[(ReBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship-based_access_control)
library for TypeScript. It allows you to define your application's authorization
rules based on your database schema, written in your favorite ORM. We currently
support [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io).

  We'll go though some concepts, but if you want to learn more about
  relationship-based authorization, check out [Google
  Zanzibar](https://zanzibar.academy/) which RebaTS was heavily inspired by!

## Installation

The library is split up into 3 layers:

- You define your permissions using the `@rebats/core` library.

  ```package-install
  npm i @rebats/core
  ```

- It reads your database schema and executes the queries through your ORM of
  choice using a **database adapter**. You should already have Drizzle or Prisma
  installed.

  ```package-install
  npm i @rebats/drizzle # for Drizzle
  npm i @rebats/prisma # for Prisma
  ```

  <Callout type="warn">
    RebaTS depends on Drizzle's Relational Query Builder V2 API which is
    currently in beta. You'll need to install the beta version of both
    `drizzle-orm` and `drizzle-kit` and use the new `defineRelations` function
    to use RebaTS. See the Drizzle guide for more info about the migration.
  </Callout>

- **Server adapters** take these rules to authorize incoming requests for your
  endpoints. You can use the methods provided by the core library to perform
  auth check but they will make integrating RebaTS with your library more
  seamless.

  ```package-install
  npm i @rebats/express # for Express
  npm i @rebats/next # for Next.js
  npm i @rebats/nest # for NestJS
  ```

## Defining relationships and actions

Securing your application starts with defining your relationships and actions.
Relationships represents connections between your sujects (database tables) and
actions are, well, the actions that these subjects can perform.
