title: Defining permissions
---

Let's say you are building a GitHub-style version control system:

<Callout>
  `Subject` are marked with code blocks, _relations_ with italic and **actions**
  with bold text.
</Callout>

`Developers` can **create repositories** inside their `Organization`s. Only
_members_ of the `Organization` can **view** them, the _owner_ and
_collaborators_ added by the owner can **edit** them. We can even simplify this
by making the _owner_ inherit the _collaborator_ relationship.
